This project was for the Mechatronics System Design II course offered at the Lebanese American University.

 The goal of this project is to showcase modern control technologies, it utilizes fuzzy logic to control an 
 air pump which in turn controls the height of a ping-pong ball or any lighter object.
 To sense the distance an ultra-sonic sensor is used.
